# AURO Graphics Website

This repository contains the complete source code for the AURO Graphics portfolio website. It is built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with no backend or frameworks required.

## ðŸš€ Hosting on GitHub Pages (Live Demo)

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:** Create a new public repository on your GitHub account.
2.  **Upload Files:** Upload all the files and folders (`index.html`, `admin.html`, `css/`, `js/`, `assets/`) to this new repository.
3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * In your repository, go to `Settings` > `Pages`.
    * Under the "Branch" section, select `main` (or `master`) and `/root` for the folder.
    * Click `Save`.
4.  **Access Your Site:** Your website will be live in a few minutes at the URL provided by GitHub, typically `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

## ðŸ”’ Accessing the Admin Panel

The admin panel is not linked anywhere on the main website for security through obscurity. To access it, manually add `admin.html` to the end of your website's URL.

* **Local:** `file:///path/to/your/folder/auro-graphics/admin.html`
* **Live:** `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/admin.html`

From the admin panel, you can upload new portfolio work, add details, and delete existing entries. All data is saved directly in your browser's `localStorage`.
